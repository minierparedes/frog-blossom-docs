## In this structure

- `cmd`: Contains the main executable code (`main.go`) for the application.
- `internal`: Contains internal packages/modules that are not intended to be used by external packages. This includes `application`, `adapter`, `domain`, and `config`.
  - `application`: Contains business logic or services (`service.go`).
  - `adapter`: Contains adapters for inbound and outbound communication.
    - `inbound`: Contains adapters for handling incoming requests, such as HTTP handlers (`handler.go`, equivalent to Controller).
    - `outbound`: Contains adapters for external systems, such as database repositories (`repository.go`, equivalent to Repository).
  - `domain`: Contains domain-specific logic and models (`model.go`, equivalent to Model).
  - `config`: Contains configuration files or structures (`appconfig.go`).
- `test`: Contains test-related code, including unit tests, integration tests, and test utilities.
  - `unit_tests`: Testing individual components or units of code in isolation.
  - `end_to_end_tests`: Testing the application's behavior across multiple components or systems. Tests user scenarios and interactions with the entire application.

## Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC)

Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC) can be implemented to achieve loose coupling and improve testability.

1. **Dependency Injection (DI)**:
   - DI is the process of providing dependencies to a component from the outside rather than creating them internally. It allows for better separation of concerns and facilitates easier testing and maintenance.
   - In the context of the given structure, DI can be implemented by passing dependencies (such as repositories, services, or configuration objects) as parameters to the constructors or methods of the components that require them.
   - For example, in the `service.go` file within the `application` package, dependencies such as repositories or other services can be injected into the service constructor or methods rather than being instantiated internally.

2. **Inversion of Control (IoC)**:
   - IoC is a broader concept that refers to the inversion of control over the flow of a program. Instead of components controlling the flow of execution, control is inverted to a framework or container that manages the components and their dependencies.
   - In the given structure, IoC can be achieved by using a DI container or framework to manage the instantiation and wiring of components and their dependencies.
   - For example, a DI container such as Google Wire or Uber Dig can be used to define the dependencies and their relationships in a configuration file, and the container will then automatically instantiate and inject dependencies when components are requested.
   - Alternatively, manual IoC can be achieved by explicitly wiring dependencies in the main application entry point (`main.go`) or using initialization functions to configure and wire components.

Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC) are closely related concepts that work together to achieve loosely coupled and modular software design.

1. **Inversion of Control (IoC)**:
   - IoC is a design principle that involves inverting the control of program flow from the components to a higher-level framework or container.
   - In traditional programming, components are responsible for creating and managing their dependencies, which can lead to tight coupling and poor maintainability.
   - IoC flips this control by delegating the responsibility of creating and managing dependencies to an external framework or container. This allows components to focus on their core functionality without worrying about how their dependencies are instantiated or wired together.
   - IoC containers or frameworks manage the instantiation and lifecycle of components and their dependencies, typically through configuration files, annotations, or code conventions.

2. **Dependency Injection (DI)**:
   - DI is a design pattern that implements IoC by injecting dependencies into a component from the outside rather than creating them internally.
   - Instead of a component creating its dependencies directly, the dependencies are provided to the component through constructor parameters, setter methods, or interfaces.
   - DI allows for better separation of concerns, as components are not responsible for creating or managing their dependencies. It also makes components more reusable and testable, as dependencies can be easily mocked or substituted during testing.
   - DI can be implemented manually or using DI containers or frameworks, which automatically inject dependencies based on configuration or annotations.

**Working Together**:

- IoC provides the overarching principle of delegating control to a higher-level framework or container, while DI is a specific implementation of IoC that focuses on managing dependencies.
- IoC containers or frameworks often incorporate DI as a key feature, allowing developers to define dependencies and their relationships and letting the container handle the instantiation and injection of dependencies.
- Together, DI and IoC promote modular, flexible, and testable software architectures by decoupling components and their dependencies, improving code maintainability, and facilitating the development of scalable and extensible systems.

To implement Dependency Injection (DI) in the provided project structure, we need to modify the components to accept their dependencies from the outside rather than creating them internally. Here's how we can adapt the structure to incorporate DI:

1. **Modify Application Components**:
   - Update the constructors or methods of components (such as services and adapters) to accept their dependencies as parameters.
   - Components should rely on interfaces rather than concrete implementations to promote flexibility and ease of substitution.

2. **Define Interfaces**:
   - Define interfaces for dependencies, such as repositories, services, or external systems, to decouple components from their implementations.
   - Components should depend on interfaces rather than concrete types to enable interchangeable implementations.

3. **Configure Dependency Injection**:
   - Configure the wiring of dependencies in the main application entry point (`main.go`) or using a DI container or framework if desired.
   - Instantiate components and their dependencies, passing dependencies to components through their constructors or methods.

## Project structure implementing DI

```bash
├── cmd
│   └── main.go
├── internal
│   ├── application
│   │   ├── service.go (Accepts dependencies through constructor)
│   │   └── service_impl.go (Implements service interface)
│   ├── adapter
│   │   ├── inbound
│   │   │   ├── http
│   │   │   │   ├── handler.go (Accepts dependencies through constructor)
│   │   │   │   └── handler_impl.go (Implements handler interface)
│   │   ├── outbound
│   │   │   └── persistence
│   │   │       ├── repository.go (Accepts dependencies through constructor)
│   │   │       └── repository_impl.go (Implements repository interface)
│   ├── domain
│   │   └── model.go
│   └── config
│       └── appconfig.go
└── test
    ├── unit_tests
    └── end_to_end_tests
```

In this structure:

- Application components (services, handlers, repositories) accept their dependencies through constructor parameters.
- Interfaces are defined for dependencies to decouple components from their implementations.
- Dependencies can be configured and wired in the main application entry point (`main.go`) or using a DI container or framework.
